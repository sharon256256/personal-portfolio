        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I got into software engineering to determine whether it could be a career choice for me, and so far, it's okay. My goal is to create a career that allows me to express myself through the things I love while having the freedom to shape my own path.</p>
        <p>One of my proudest moments in high school was as the Chair of the Wildlife Club. To deal with low membership, I organized a school-wide competition for essays, poems, and art. It successfully increased membership and was a rewarding leadership experience.</p>

            <h2>My Love for Baking üç∞</h2>
            <p>
                It all started with a craving. Not just for cake, but for the magic of creating something from scratch. The first time I baked, I was mesmerized by how simple ingredients‚Äîflour, sugar, eggs, and butter‚Äîcould transform into something so warm, soft, and sweet. That feeling of watching a cake rise in the oven? Pure joy.

What started as a curiosity quickly became a passion. I began experimenting, trying new flavors, testing different techniques, and, of course, making a mess in the kitchen. Before I knew it, baking became more than just a hobby‚Äîit became something I wanted to share.

That‚Äôs when I decided to turn my passion into a business. I started selling cakes, each one baked with love and a touch of creativity. Every order I get is a reminder of why I do this‚Äîbecause nothing beats the happiness of seeing someone enjoy something I made or the nervousness when someone gives me their reviewüòÖ.

Plus, I get to eat cakes whenever I want! üòÜ And it doesn‚Äôt stop there‚ÄîI bake my own cookies, biscuits, sweets, toffees, √©clairs, and even chocolate. There‚Äôs just something special about creating my own treats from scratch, knowing exactly what goes into them, and making them taste just the way I like.

Baking isn‚Äôt just about mixing ingredients; it‚Äôs about creating moments, memories, and pure happiness‚Äîone cake or sweet treat at a time. üíï
